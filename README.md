# Clima ☁

## My Goal

The goal of this project is to learn asynchronous programming in Dart by adding functionality to the application such as retrieving weather data from the API based on GPS location from the phone. As always, I try to model a beautiful UI. This time I modeled a UI designed by [Asish Sunny](https://dribbble.com/shots/11474539-Weather-App).

## Funcionality

So far, the app is able to retrieve and present data based on location and when a city is entered. 
When first launched, the data presented is from location. 
The data that is presented is: City, Temperature, General weather condition (sunny, overcast, rain, snow) in the form of an icon.

## What I have learned

- How to use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
- Understand async and await.
- Learn about Futures and how to work with them.
- How to network with the Dart http package.
- What APIs are and how to use them to get data from the internet.
- What JSONs are and how to parse them using the Dart convert package.
- How to pass data forwards and backwards between screens using the Navigator.
- How to handle exceptions in Dart using try/catch/throw.
- Learn about the lifecycle of Stateful Widgets and how to override them.
- How to use the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
- How to use the TextField Widget to take user input.

## Future Goals

- Replace current UI with UI designed by Arish Sunny
- Retrieve and present additional data from the API such as weather for days ahead, air quality, sunrise/sunset.

## Additional information

The project would not have succeeded if not for Angela Yu's wonderful bootcamp. I encourage you to take it because it is very valuable.
